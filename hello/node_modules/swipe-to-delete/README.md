# Swipe-to-delete Marionette View
Implement the "swipe to delete" UI-pattern in the Marionette framework.

## Example
You may see an example [here](http://gaer87.github.io/swipe-to-delete/example/).

## Usage
This is a plugin built on top of the base Marionette LayoutView. It contains two regions: "content" and "delete". A content region show your a view. A delete region show a decoration view under the content view. It's showed when content view is swiped.

Usually, the swipe-to-delete view is used in the Marionette CollectionView.

```
var collectionView = Backbone.Marionette.CollectionView.extend({
	childView: SwipeToDeleteView.default,
	childViewOptions: function () {
		return {
			View: MessageView
		};
	}
});
```

- *childView* contains the swipe-to-delete Marionette view.
- *childViewOptions* returns its options.

### Include lib
It's available on *SwipeToDeleteView*.**default**.
#### CommonJS
```
var SwipeToDeleteView = require('swipe-to-delete');
// SwipeToDeleteView.default
```
#### AMD
```
define(['swipe-to-delete'], function(SwipeToDeleteView) {
	// SwipeToDeleteView.default
});
```
#### Global
```
<script src="node_modules/swipe-to-delete/dist/swipe-to-delete.min.js"></script>
<script>
// SwipeToDeleteView.default
</script>
```

### Options
- **View** - This must be your a view object definition, not an instance. It can be any Backbone.View or be derived from Marionette.ItemView. *Required*.
- **DeleteView** - This is a decoration view object definition under a content view. By default, showed red element with trash icons. *Optional*.
- **deleteSwipe** - This is a number. If a content view is swiped more this the number than a swipe-to-delete view will start a delete animation. By default, it's equal "0.5". *Optional*.

### Events
The swipe-to-delete view triggers following events on a content view:
- **swipe:delete** - when a delete animation is ended. It's used to destroy entity.
```
onSwipeDelete: function () {
	this.model.destroy();
}
```
- **swipe:cancel** - when a cancel animation is ended.

### Styles
You may set up styles in "swipe-to-delete.css" under the comment "Custom styles". The class *js-content* is content region, *js-delete* is delete region. Classes *js-transition-delete-right* and *js-transition-delete-left* are added on a content view when it's swiped more than "deleteSwipe" options. Class *js-transition-cancel* is added when a content view swiped less than "deleteSwipe" options. Animations are made by CSS3 transition.
